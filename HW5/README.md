Implement SpMV (here, you have to submit a compilable and runnable version of c or c++ code) using the COO format. [2 marks]

Note 1: A reference sequential implementation and dataset are provided (compile: g++ main.cpp mm_helper.cpp run: ./a.out <datasetname> (e.g. ./a.out small.mtx))

Note 2: You are allowed to copy paste code from the reference code provided, but not from anywhere else (copying from each other or from outside will result in an F grade)
